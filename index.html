                            <p>  
                                At WELD, the technology role is key in delivering outstanding results in concert with all digital marketing initiatives. Joshua played this part with a hands-on role from design to development for all of WELD’s clients, including Nestle Waters, Dannon, Pernod Ricard Brands, CVS and Dunkin Donuts.
